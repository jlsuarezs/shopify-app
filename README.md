# Sezion app for Shopify

Sezion app for Shopify is an embedded app to create dynamic videos based on the information about any shop products: clothes, forniture, handmade jewelry, etc.
It uses the Shopify API to get all this information and you select what content you want to use for the custom video.

## Usage

* First, you need a Sezion account. For more details go to [Sezion.com](https://sezion.com) and register.
* Write your `account_id`and `account_secret` in the correct fields and save them. You can find this credentials in the admin page in Sezion.
* Select which products you want videos from.
* Select a video template to use. You'll see a video example with the template chosen to have an idea of the result.
* Fill out the different dynamic fields of the video with information about your products.
* Create your video(s) and send them to your youtube account. 

 In order to do this, you need first to connect your Youtube account to Sezion and write down the `id`you receive.

# For developers

The app is developed using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) for the server-side and [EJS](http://embeddedjs.com/) for client-side.

## Setting up

Before running this project, you need to create a Shopify account and create an app. You can follow the Shopify developerâ€™s [Getting Started](http://docs.shopify.com/api/the-basics/getting-started) guide. When you're creating the app you will be asked to give the Application Callback URL. In this project we chose to host the app at the URL https://localhost:3000.

    $ node shopify_app.js -c etc/shopify_app_public.conf

The configuration file has the `api_key` and the `secret` for Shopify. More info: http://www.shopify.com/partners/apps

**Note**: Shopify uses HTTPS, so to test it in `localhost` you need certificates or it won't work properly.

## Structure

To start creating videos, first you need templates. In `public/scripts` is were templates' scripts are stored. One file for each template. 
The process for a new video using the Sezion SDK (in `public/js`) is:

1. Read the script file. It's a `json`.
2. Create the template object and call `TemplateNew`. This returns an `id` that we need later.
3. For every product selected to create a video, validate the dynamic fields and create the video object.
4. Call `TemplateVideoNew` with the `id` mentioned before and the video object. The video is now processed by Sezion and you receive it's id.

## Develop for other CMSs

Almost all the front-end code can be use to develop an app for another platform, not only Shopify. There are specific lines for Shopify which are commented out.
